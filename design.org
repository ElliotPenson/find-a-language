* User Stories

  As a user, I would like to...

  - Find the programming language that best matches my preferences.
  - Learn more about the language I encounter.
  - Discover similar languages to a given language.
  - Browse a list of all programming languages.

* Pages

** Home Page

   Users indicate which language attributes they prefer. For example, one may
   declare a preference for static rather than dynamically-typed languages. Each
   choice should be defined. The site navigates users to a page for the language
   (/Language Page/) that best fits their preferences.

   Users may also choose to navigate to a page that lists all languages (see
   /Browse Page/ below).

** Language Page

   Contents:
   - Large heading (e.g. ~Python~).
   - Color from GitHub.
   - Attributes (e.g. popularity, typing, paradigm, etc).
   - Top projects (by GitHub stars).
   - Similar languages.

** Browse Page

   A table of all programming languages with columns /Color/, /Name/, and
   /Popularity/. Users can order by column.

* Flow

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Home -> Language | Browse
  Language -> Home
  Language -> Browse
  #+END_SRC

  ~Home~ will navigate users to ~Language~ after the user enters their language
  preferences. A named link (e.g. "or view all languages") will let users
  navigate to ~Browse~. ~Home~ and ~Browse~ will have a back arrow (or a home
  icon).
